/* For Part 4: [Finishing the game]
For Part 4 you need to extend the JavaScript code developed in parts 2 and 3, mainly to handle the events and game logic.
Variables
    A variable called theBody is created. This points to the body e.g.
    var theBody = document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0];
Add an event handler function to the extra face
    After cloning the node, you need to add an onclick event handler function to the last child of the left side, which is the face that the player is supposed to click on
    Your code for constructing the event handler function for that node will look similar to this:
        theLeftSide.lastChild.onclick=function nextLevel(event){
        event.stopPropagation();
        numberOfFaces += 5;
        generateFaces();
        };
The code theLeftSide.lastChild.onclick=function nextLevel(event){ ...}
means that we are constructing a function which will be executed when the user clicks on the last child node in theLeftSide.
The name of the function being created (nextLevel()) is not particularly important, it can be anything appropriate.
    The line event.stopPropagation(); is necessary in order to ensure that the event does not also get applied to other elements in the web page, such as other faces. That would trigger the function multiple times, which is not what we want.
    The line numberOfFaces += 5;
increases the number stored in numberOfFaces by 5, so that the next time the faces are generated there are 5 more than before on both sides
    The line generateFaces();
means that a new set of faces is generated. Because of the increase in value of numberOfFaces there will be 5 more faces than before on both sides.

Add an event handler function to the body
 You need to add another function for handling the situation when the player clicks on anything except the correct face
 Your code for constructing the event handler function will look similar to this:
    theBody.onclick = function gameOver() {
        alert("Game Over!");
        theBody.onclick = null;
        theLeftSide.lastChild.onclick = null;
    };
    The line
    theBody.onclick = function gameOver() {
    means that we are constructing a function which will be executed when the user clicks on theBody.
    The name of the function being created (gameOver()) is not particularly important, it can be anything appropriate.
    The line alert("Game Over!");
    is one way to show a message to the user
    The line theBody.onclick = null;
    means that from now onwards nothing will happen when the user clicks anywhere in the web page
    The line
    theLeftSide.lastChild.onclick = null;
    means that from now onwards nothing will happen when the user clicks on the extra face.
Delete the child nodes
    Remember that each time the player clicks on the correct face all faces are removed and a new set of faces are generated.
    So that means at the appropriate place all children under the leftSide div and rightSide div need to be deleted.
    You previously learnt how to delete all child nodes on the course using a while loop. */
